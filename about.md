## Mini Camps

In the summer of 2018, 8 two day mini-camps will be held at 8 different schools in Ukraine.

On the first day, students will be taught basic programming concepts and how to write simple programs using the Scratch programming language. Students will then use MIT App Inventor to develop an Android mobile app.

On the second day, students will be introduced to electronics and robotics using Raspberry Pi's and mBot kits. Students will work in teams of 3-4 to program their mBots and Pi's to solve problems and perform tasks.

Additionally, a guest speaker who work in Ukraineâ€™s IT industry will be invited to talk about their profession, how they established their career, and offer advice to students interested in the growing field of IT.

Schools will receive 2 mBots, 2 Raspberry Pi kits, and a project manual to help establish a programming club and use in regular classroom instruction in exchange for hosting a camp.

If you would like your school to be considered as a mini-camp host, please fill out the <a href="/apply">application form</a>.
